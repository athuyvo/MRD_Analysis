# MRD Analysis with Salish Biosciences

This project is in collaboration with Salish Biosciences to test the sensitivity and specificity of a minimal residual disease (MRD) clinical assay that's designed for early cancer detection in patients who have been treated or undergoing treatment.
This data contains human circulating free DNA (cfDNA  with computational "spiked in" circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutations. 
These scripts were developed to assess the validity of the MRD assay and build a custom pipeline to accurately call the tumor mutations present in the assay data.
